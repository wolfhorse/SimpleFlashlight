Simple Flashlight
=================

This Android  app was developed as a way to start familiarizing myself more with the Android Development Studio IDE, Google Play Development Console, Google Play Store along with GitHub. Feel free to use this code as a reference or to update it and make it better. Keep the permissions required to only what the app needs to do it's primary job. No ads and no nag screens either. Keep it simple and clean for the user.

The [Simple Flashlight app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wolfhorse.simpleflashlight) can be downloaded from Google Play for free.
